# Halogen

Systemic magic mod, in Aura Cascade and Botania's lineage. At least that's what it's supposed to be.

The ideas are vague, and out of step with the implementation at the moment.

## what to do

I want to experiment with making this more like vazkii's old "closed loop" mod idea (if that's okay with them). Entirely scrap the Aura Cascade gravity mechanic, remove AuraStack (aura is indivisible units), etc. Will need to do that.

moonlight prisms - I still like this mechanic a lot. I think it should be the entry point for obtaining your first aura (is it still called aura) crystals

Yes i know overground small geodes are too common it's for testing purposes

### Things to look at

can i tweak specifically the amethyst geode feature that is used in worldgen, instead of blindly patching GeodeFeature
